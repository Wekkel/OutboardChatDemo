     App.xaml - The Application Definition File
     =========================================================================

     WHAT IS THIS FILE?
     ==================
     App.xaml is the "entry point" configuration for a WPF application.
     It tells WPF:
     1. What class represents the Application (x:Class)
     2. Which window to show when the app starts (StartupUri)
     3. What resources (styles, colors, templates) are shared app-wide

     THE APPLICATION CLASS
     =====================
     Every WPF app has an Application object that manages:
     - The application lifecycle (starting, running, shutting down)
     - Global resources available to all windows
     - Application-wide settings and properties

     The x:Class attribute points to OutboardChatDemo.App, which is the
     C# class in App.xaml.cs. For simple apps like this one, that file
     is usually empty because the default behavior is fine.

     STARTUP URI
     ===========
     StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml" tells WPF:
     "When the application starts, create and show MainWindow."

     This is the simplest way to start a WPF app. For more complex apps,
     you might override the OnStartup method in App.xaml.cs to do custom
     initialization before showing the window.

     APPLICATION RESOURCES
     =====================
     The <Application.Resources> section can contain:
     - Styles: Define how controls look (colors, fonts, sizes)
     - Templates: Define the structure of controls
     - Brushes: Reusable colors and gradients
     - Converters: Transform data for display

     In this demo app, we don't use global resources - each control defines
     its own appearance inline. In a larger app, you'd typically define
     styles here to keep things consistent and avoid repetition.

  <!--
       x:Class = The C# class that represents this application
       xmlns = XML namespaces for WPF controls and XAML features
       StartupUri = The first window to display when the app launches
  -->

  <!-- Application-wide resources go here. Currently empty for this demo. -->
  <Application.Resources>
    <!--
         In a production app, you might add things like:

         <Style TargetType="Button">
           <Setter Property="Background" Value="#2A3BFF"/>
           <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="White"/>
         </Style>

         This would make ALL buttons in the app use those colors by default.
    -->
